# What this Yeoman generator is already capable of

* Ask basic questions to the user so it can generate package.json && bower.json files with all the project details
* Creates lint files (both .csslintrc & .jshintrc)
* Adds a .gitignore file

# What this Yeoman generator is already capable of, but unit tests are still missing

* It uses require.js to load these basic JS libraries:

  * text/JSON require.js loader
  * domReady
  * Handlebars
* Build a basic Gulp toolchain feat.:

  * Connect server
  * File watcher
  * HTML: (usemin's) minifier
  * CSS: CSSLint, Autoprefixer, (usemin's) concat & minifier
  * JS: JSHint, (usemin's) uglifier, concat, rev.
* Adds an index.html / playground page to link all this together.

# What this Yeoman generator will (most likely) do

* Add a basic reset CSS file (there is a YUI reset in there, but it'd be nice to load it using bower, I hate /vendor folders)
* Add a dummy CSS file (there is one already, but it acts most likely as a placeholder; usemin loves to complain about empty blocks)
* _create an empty git repo?_
* Install dependencies
* Add a second page, if it's not a Single Page Application
* Add cucumber.js/functional testing
* Prepare some coffee and roll a cigarette :)

# Questions
Just some random thoughts about the questions to prompt to the user. I think it's better to add those here instead of using a planning tool. I wouldn't update that anyway. Public is better (and there's for sure somebody out there who has better ideas than mines).

## Browser support
There are some browser (version)-dependant dependencies or rules, like HTML5 shim for IE8-, and the CSS vendor prefixes (handled by autoprefixer). Having this information would help generating less shitty code (eg.: why the hell should I include html5shim if I just need to support IE10+?)

## CSS reset?
Provide a shortlist of different CSS resets, like:

* No reset css, let the browser use its own stylesheets by default
* Remove inconsistent cross-browser styling (aka: yui reset, normalize.css)
* Get rid of all browser stylesheets in a well mannered way (reset CSS)

## JS framework?
I'd like to avoid including the whole jQuery thingy by default. And customizing it thru this generator is not really an option, imho. Providing the choice between:

* zepto
* underscore/lodash

Would be better (note for the future: it could be worth adding some other helpful microjs framework too). In any case, AMD modules will be used. CommonJS FTW!

## Templating system
Defaults to handlebars. Maybe: it could be worth checking which are the other ones already available with AMD support.

## "Compiled" files folder
There two different "compiled" folders right now:

* **css/dist** for the autoprefixed CSS files
* **build** for the final html/js/css files

Providing a question to change this would be highly appreciated, I suppose.

## SPA or multipage?
This is not really an expensive task: it's just about adding an almost-exact-copy of the index.html file, with a different name and a different js endpoint. But it could be worth adding it.
