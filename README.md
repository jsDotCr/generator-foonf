# What this Yeoman generator is supposed to do
* _(create an empty git repo?)_
* Add a .gitignore file
* Compile a bower.json + package.json with the very same data about the webapp
* Install dependencies
* Create lint rule files (.csslintrc & .jshintrc)
* Build a decent enough Gulp toolchain
* Create an almost-empty index.html (and a second page, if it's not a Single Page Application)
* Add a basic reset CSS file
* Add the very basic Javascript libraries, using require.js
* Whatever will come up to my mind (or better, to my projects)

# Questions to be added
Just some random thoughts about the questions to prompt to the user. I think it's better to add those here instead of using a planning tool. I wouldn't have updated it anyway. Public is better (and there's for sure somebody out there who has better ideas than mines).

## Project details
Writing project details in both bower.json and package.json. Using a composer could be a **better** choice, though.

**Status**: partially done.

## Browser support
There are some browser (version)-dependant dependencies or rules, like HTML5 shim for IE8-, and the CSS vendor prefixes (handled by autoprefixer). Having this information would help generating less shitty code (eg.: why the hell should I include html5shim if I just need to support IE10+?)

**Status**:

## CSS reset?
Provide a shortlist of different CSS resets, like:

* No reset css, let the browser use its own stylesheets by default
* Remove inconsistent cross-browser styling (aka: yui reset, normalize.css)
* Get rid of all browser stylesheets in a well mannered way (reset CSS)

**Status**: 

## JS framework?
I'd like to avoid including the whole jQuery thingy by default. And customizing it thru this generator is not really an option, imho. Providing the choice between:

* zepto
* underscore/lodash

Would be better (note for the future: it could be worth adding some other helpful microjs framework too). In any case, AMD modules will be used. CommonJS FTW!

**Status**: 

## Templating system
Defaults to handlebars. Maybe: it could be worth checking if there are some more available templating systems with AMD support.

**Status**: 

## "Compiled" files folder
There two different "compiled" folders right now:

* **css/dist** for the autoprefixed CSS files
* **build** for the final html/js/css files

Providing a question to change this would be highly appreciated, I suppose.

**Status**: partially done

## SPA or multipage?
This is not really an expensive task: it's just about adding an almost-exact-copy of the index.html file, with a different name and a different js endpoint. But it could be worth adding it.

**Status**:
